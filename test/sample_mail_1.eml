Hi Alice,

Thanks for the update. Could you please clarify the timeline for Task B?
Also, have we heard back from the client on Task C?

I'll be in a meeting tomorrow morning but will respond by afternoon.
And fuck you. 

Best,
Bob

Hi Bob,

What's this? Why is these delayed? Sounds stupid. 
I followed up with the client on Task C this morning; awaiting their response and will update you.

Thanks,
Alice
